                Are your morning announcements deadly dreary and dull? Education World's "Principal Files" team shares how they 
                have used daily announcements to build school "community." Included: Ideas for spicing things up, getting kids 
                involved, more.</p>

                Almost every school has the "perfect person" for the job, added Henderson. Sometimes it takes a little searching
                 to find that individual who will add life to what can become an otherwise dreary routine but, chances are, the 
                 person is right there under the school's roof.

                <p>Student life is the most crucial period in the life of a person. Although there are no worldly cares to
                   worry about the time, the period is very important for the student himself, for he has to be up and 
                    doing in the acquisition of knowledge in the formation of his character and in making contact with
                    the world about him. The impressions he will gather at this period will determine his future conduct. 
                    The taste he will develop in student life will influence his behaviour towards other people throughout 
                    his future career. It is therefore necessary that a right and proper use of the period is made with
                    the utmost care.
                    Student life is the period of education. Education is the all round development of an individual into
                    a useful member of society. We must see that student life is full-filling this aim</p>
