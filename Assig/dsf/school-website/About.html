                Are your morning announcements deadly dreary and dull? Education World's "Principal Files" team shares how they 
                have used daily announcements to build school "community." Included: Ideas for spicing things up, getting kids 
                involved, more.</p>

                Almost every school has the "perfect person" for the job, added Henderson. Sometimes it takes a little searching
                 to find that individual who will add life to what can become an otherwise dreary routine but, chances are, the 
                 person is right there under the school's roof.

                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>Disciplining children is important to create a safe and fun learning environment. Discipline requires knowledge, 
                    skill, sensitivity and self-confidence; like any art, it is something that will acquire through training and 
                    experience; it becomes easier with practice. Many people confuse discipline with classroom management; discipline 
                    is one dimension of classroom management and classroom management is a general term. [2]

                    Discipline was brought up due to misbehaving students. Students misbehave because of the lack of 
                    engagement and stimulation, a rigid definition of acceptable behaviors and lack of attention and love.
                    Student life is the period of education. Education is the all round development of an individual into
                    a useful member of society. We must see that student life is full-filling this aim</p>
