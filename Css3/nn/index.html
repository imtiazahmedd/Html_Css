    If youâ€™re considering a website redesign or are wondering how to generate more leads from your website, it's a good idea to start with your homepage. 

Serving as your company's virtual front door, this page is generally responsible for drawing in a majority of your website's traffic. And despite its prominence, many businesses struggle to optimize it properly.
